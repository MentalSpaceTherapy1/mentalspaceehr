# Security Phase 2 Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Phase 2 security fixes have been successfully implemented focusing on rate limiting, supervisor validation, and self-registration security.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Rate Limiting System (`src/lib/rateLimit.ts`)

**Purpose**: Prevent abuse of sensitive operations through automated rate limiting.

**Features**:
- Tracks operations per user with configurable limits
- Automatic cleanup of expired records
- Returns remaining attempts and reset time

**Applied To**:
- Password reset: 3 attempts per hour
- User creation: 10 attempts per hour per admin
- Invitation sending: 10 attempts per hour per admin

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
const rateLimit = checkRateLimit(userId, 'operation_name', maxAttempts, windowMs);
if (rateLimit.isLimited) {
  // Block operation and inform user
}
```

### 2. Supervisor Assignment Validation (`src/pages/admin/UserProfile.tsx`)

**Security Checks Implemented**:
1. ✅ Supervisor must be active (`is_active = true`)
2. ✅ Supervisor must have valid license number
3. ✅ Supervisor capacity check (max 10 supervisees)
4. ✅ Validates supervisor qualifications before assignment

**Benefits**:
- Prevents assignment of unqualified supervisors
- Ensures supervisors aren't overloaded
- Maintains clinical quality standards
- Protects against administrative errors

### 3. Self-Registration HIPAA Warning (`src/components/admin/portal/PortalSettings.tsx`)

**Implementation**:
- Added prominent warning when self-registration is enabled
- Explains HIPAA compliance risks
- Recommends invitation-only access
- Default setting: DISABLED (secure by default)

**Warning Message**:
> "HIPAA Security Warning: Self-registration is NOT recommended for clinical practices. Enabling this feature without proper verification (MRN + DOB match, admin approval, identity verification) may expose Protected Health Information (PHI) to unauthorized individuals. For HIPAA compliance, use invitation-only access with proper client verification."

## Security Improvements Summary

### Before Phase 2
- ❌ No rate limiting on sensitive operations
- ❌ Supervisors could be assigned without validation
- ❌ Self-registration could be enabled without warning

### After Phase 2
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Supervisor assignments are validated for qualifications
- ✅ Self-registration has clear HIPAA warning
- ✅ Default secure configuration (self-registration OFF)

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**
   - Configuration change in Supabase Auth settings
   - Enable haveibeenpwned.com integration

2. **Audit Database Functions**
   - Add `SET search_path = public` to all functions
   - Review all SECURITY DEFINER functions

3. **Restrict Note Template Access**
   - Update RLS policies on `note_templates` table
   - Require authentication for SELECT

4. **Add Security Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns
   - Monitor rate limit triggers
   - Track role assignment changes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Test password reset limit (3 attempts)
   - Test user creation limit (10 per hour)
   - Verify reset time calculations

2. **Supervisor Validation**:
   - Try assigning inactive supervisor (should fail)
   - Try assigning supervisor without license (should fail)
   - Try assigning supervisor at capacity (should fail)

3. **Self-Registration Warning**:
   - Toggle self-registration ON
   - Verify warning appears
   - Confirm warning is clear and actionable

## Compliance Notes

- All changes align with HIPAA Security Rule requirements
- Rate limiting helps prevent unauthorized access attempts
- Supervisor validation ensures qualified oversight
- Self-registration warning promotes secure configuration

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/rateLimit.ts` - NEW: Rate limiting utility
2. `src/pages/ForgotPassword.tsx` - Added rate limiting
3. `src/pages/admin/CreateUser.tsx` - Added rate limiting
4. `src/pages/admin/UserProfile.tsx` - Added supervisor validation + rate limiting
5. `src/components/admin/portal/PortalSettings.tsx` - Added HIPAA warning
