# Operational Excellence Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the systematic rollout of operational excellence improvements for the MentalSpace EHR system. The plan is structured in 4 phases over 12 weeks, prioritizing production readiness and HIPAA compliance.

## Implementation Philosophy

- **Security First**: HIPAA compliance and data protection are non-negotiable
- **Incremental Rollout**: Each phase builds on the previous one
- **Document-Test-Deploy**: Every change follows this pattern
- **Stakeholder Buy-in**: RACI ensures clear ownership and accountability
