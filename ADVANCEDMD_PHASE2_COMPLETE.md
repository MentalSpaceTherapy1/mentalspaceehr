const { eligibility, isChecking } = useAutoEligibilityCheck(
  clientId,
  insuranceId,
  serviceDate
);
```

### Schedule View
Show status on appointments:
```typescript
{eligibility?.coverageStatus === 'Active' && (
  <Badge>Coverage Verified ✓</Badge>
)}
```

## Workflows Implemented

### 1. New Patient Eligibility Check
```
Patient arrives → Open chart → Navigate to Insurance →
Click "Check Eligibility" → Auto-check (if >24hr) →
Display benefits → Review coverage → Proceed
```

### 2. Insurance Card Upload
```
Receive card → Open upload → Take photo/scan →
Drag-drop → Upload to storage → OCR extraction →
Preview data → Verify accuracy → Save
```

### 3. Patient Sync
```
New patient registered → Enter insurance →
Click "Sync to AdvancedMD" → Validate fields →
API call → Save Patient ID → Ready for billing
```

### 4. Auto-Verification on Appointment
```
Create appointment → Hook triggers → Check cache →
If valid: Show cached → If expired: Real-time check →
Cache result → Display status → Continue scheduling
```
