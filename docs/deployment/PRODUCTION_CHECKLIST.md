## Deployment Day Checklist

### Pre-Deployment (T-4 hours)
- [ ] **Team notification**: Alert all team members of deployment window
- [ ] **Maintenance window**: Schedule and communicate to users
- [ ] **Backup verification**: Confirm latest backup is successful
- [ ] **Rollback plan review**: Team reviews rollback procedures
- [ ] **Support team briefed**: Support ready for post-deployment issues

### Deployment (T-0)
- [ ] **Code freeze**: No new code changes during deployment
- [ ] **Deploy database migrations**: Apply all pending migrations
- [ ] **Deploy application code**: Push to production
- [ ] **Verify deployment**: Confirm new version is live
- [ ] **Run smoke tests**: Test critical user flows
- [ ] **Monitor error rates**: Check error tracking dashboard
- [ ] **Check system health**: Verify Performance Dashboard shows healthy status

### Post-Deployment (T+1 hour)
- [ ] **Monitor key metrics**:
  - [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
  - [ ] Response time < 500ms (95th percentile)
  - [ ] Database connections stable
  - [ ] No spikes in slow queries
- [ ] **User acceptance spot check**: Test as end user
- [ ] **Check critical workflows**:
  - [ ] User login/authentication
  - [ ] Patient record access
  - [ ] Appointment scheduling
  - [ ] Clinical note creation
  - [ ] Billing operations
- [ ] **Email/SMS notifications working**: Send test notifications
- [ ] **Backup verification**: Ensure post-deployment backup successful

- **Check**:
  - [ ] Error rate
  - [ ] Response times
  - [ ] Active users
  - [ ] Database performance
  - [ ] Failed logins
  - [ ] Support tickets

#### Hour 4-12
- **Frequency**: Every hour

### Rollback Steps
1. **Declare rollback decision**: Team lead approves
2. **Notify stakeholders**: Alert users if necessary
3. **Revert application code**: Deploy previous version
4. **Rollback database migrations** (if necessary):
   ```sql
   -- Use migration tool to rollback to previous version
   -- Document which migrations were rolled back
   ```
5. **Verify rollback success**: Run smoke tests
6. **Monitor post-rollback**: Ensure system stable
7. **Document incident**: Create post-mortem
8. **Plan fix**: Schedule bug fix deployment

### Post-Rollback Actions
