- Aging summary with totals and percentages
- Filter by date range and aging bucket
- Export to CSV
- Visual indicators for aging risk

### 2. **Payer Performance Analysis**
- Comparative metrics across insurance payers
- Collection rates and denial rates
- Average days to payment
- Total billed vs paid amounts
- Sortable by volume, collection rate, or denial rate

### 3. **Revenue Cycle Dashboard**
- Monthly revenue trends (charges vs collections)
- Net collection rate tracking
- AR aging distribution chart
- Denial rate monitoring
- Days in AR metrics
- Performance trends over 12 months

## Key Metrics

### Revenue Cycle Metrics

**Net Collection Rate:**
```
(Total Collections / Total Charges) * 100
Target: 95%+
```

**Days in AR:**
```
Average days from service date to payment
Target: <45 days
```

**Denial Rate:**
```
(Denied Claims / Total Claims) * 100
Target: <5%
```

**Clean Claim Rate:**
```
(Accepted Claims / Submitted Claims) * 100
Target: >95%
```

### AR Aging Benchmarks

- **0-30 days:** 60% of total AR (healthy)
- **31-60 days:** 25% of total AR
- **61-90 days:** 10% of total AR
- **91-120 days:** 3% of total AR
- **120+ days:** 2% of total AR (requires attention)

## Export Functionality

All reports support CSV export with the following format:

```typescript
const exportToCSV = () => {
  const headers = ['Column1', 'Column2', ...];
  const rows = data.map(row => [row.field1, row.field2, ...]);
  const csvContent = [headers, ...rows].map(row => row.join(',')).join('\n');

  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: 'text/csv' });
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = url;
  a.download = `report-${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.csv`;
  a.click();
};
```

## Performance Optimization

### Indexed Fields
- `report_type`, `generated_at`, `date_range_start/end` on reports
- `next_run_at` on scheduled reports
- All aging and performance views use indexed claim fields

### Materialized Views (Future)
For large datasets, consider materializing views:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_payer_performance AS
SELECT * FROM payer_performance_report;

-- Refresh daily
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_payer_performance;
```

## Security

### RLS Policies

```sql
-- Administrators and billing staff can access reports
CREATE POLICY "Billing staff can access reports"
  ON advancedmd_reports
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    has_role(auth.uid(), 'administrator'::app_role)
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'billing_staff'::app_role)
  );
```
