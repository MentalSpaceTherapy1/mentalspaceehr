# Security Breach Response Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures for detecting, responding to, and reporting security breaches involving protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data.

## Detection Methods

### 1. Automated Monitoring
- **Database triggers**: Detect unusual bulk access patterns (>50 records/hour)
- **Failed login tracking**: Monitor for brute force attacks (5+ failed attempts)
- **Session monitoring**: Track session timeouts and unusual activity
- **File upload scanning**: Basic malware detection on uploaded files

### 2. Manual Detection
- User reports of suspicious activity
- Staff observation of unusual system behavior
- Third-party security audit findings
- System administrator alerts

### 3. Security Incident Logging
All detected incidents are automatically logged in the `security_incidents` table with:
- Incident type and severity
- User ID and IP address
- Detection timestamp
- Investigation status

## Immediate Response (0-24 hours)

### Step 1: Contain the Breach
1. **Disable compromised accounts**
   - Immediately revoke user access
   - Force password reset for affected accounts
   
2. **Revoke access tokens**
   - Invalidate all active sessions for affected users
   - Clear trusted device records if applicable

3. **Block suspicious IP addresses**
   - Add IP addresses to blocked list
   - Review and implement firewall rules

### Step 2: Assess the Damage
1. **Identify affected PHI/data**
   - Review `portal_access_log` for data accessed
   - Determine scope of unauthorized access
   - Document all affected records

2. **Determine breach scope**
   - Count number of affected individuals
   - Identify types of information compromised
   - Calculate timeline of unauthorized access

3. **Document timeline**
   - Record discovery date
   - Identify when breach occurred
   - Document all actions taken

### Step 3: Notify Internal Stakeholders
1. **Inform administrator** (immediate)
2. **Alert compliance officer** (within 2 hours)
3. **Contact legal counsel** (within 4 hours)
4. **Notify insurance carrier** (within 24 hours)

## HIPAA Breach Notification Requirements

### Criteria for Notification
A breach is defined as unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI that compromises the security or privacy of the information.

**Threshold for notification:**
- **< 500 individuals**: Notify within 60 days
- **≥ 500 individuals**: Notify within 60 days + notify HHS immediately + media notice
- **Unsecured PHI**: Presumption of breach unless risk assessment proves low probability of compromise

### Risk Assessment Factors
Evaluate whether notification is required based on:
1. Nature and extent of PHI involved
2. Unauthorized person who accessed PHI
3. Whether PHI was actually acquired or viewed
4. Extent to which risk has been mitigated

### Timeline Requirements
- **Individual notification**: Within 60 days of discovery
- **HHS notification** (≥500): Immediately, within 60 days
- **HHS annual report** (<500): Within 60 days of year-end
- **Media notification** (≥500): Prominent media outlets in affected area

### Notification Content
All breach notifications must include:
- **Date of breach discovery**
- **Description of breach** (what happened)
- **Types of PHI involved** (names, SSNs, medical records, etc.)
- **Steps individuals should take** (credit monitoring, etc.)
- **Steps organization is taking** (investigation, prevention)
- **Contact information** for questions

### Notification Methods
1. **Individual notification**:
   - First-class mail to last known address
   - Email if individual agreed to electronic notice
   - Phone if fewer than 10 individuals

2. **Substitute notice** (if contact information insufficient):
   - Web posting for 90 days
   - Major media notice (if affecting ≥ 10 people in same area)

3. **HHS notification**:
   - Via HHS breach portal: https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/wizard_breach.jsf
   - Include same information as individual notices

## Automated Monitoring Implementation

### Database Trigger (Implemented)
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER breach_detection_trigger
AFTER INSERT ON portal_access_log
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION detect_breach_indicators();
```

This trigger automatically:
- Monitors access patterns in real-time
- Detects bulk PHI access (>50 records/hour)
- Logs incidents to `security_incidents` table
- Allows administrators to review and investigate

### Security Incidents Review
Administrators should regularly review the `security_incidents` table:

```sql
SELECT 
  incident_type,
  severity,
  description,
  user_id,
  detected_at,
  investigated
FROM security_incidents
WHERE investigated = FALSE
ORDER BY detected_at DESC;
```

### Investigation Workflow
1. **Review incident details**
2. **Conduct risk assessment**
3. **Determine if breach notification required**
4. **Update investigation status**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE security_incidents
   SET 
     investigated = TRUE,
     investigated_by = '[admin_user_id]',
     investigated_at = NOW(),
     resolution_notes = '[investigation findings]'
   WHERE id = '[incident_id]';
   ```

## Prevention Measures

### Current Safeguards
- ✅ **Encryption**: All PHI encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- ✅ **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication available
- ✅ **Session management**: 15-minute inactivity timeout
- ✅ **Access logging**: All data access logged with IP and timestamp
- ✅ **Failed login protection**: Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ **Password requirements**: 12+ characters, complexity enforced
- ✅ **Password expiration**: 90-day forced password change
- ✅ **File upload security**: Type validation, size limits, basic malware detection
- ✅ **Trusted devices**: Optional device fingerprinting for 30 days

### Recommended Enhancements
- [ ] **Advanced malware scanning**: Integrate VirusTotal or ClamAV API
- [ ] **Intrusion detection**: Implement SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- [ ] **Data loss prevention**: Monitor for large-scale data exports
- [ ] **Penetration testing**: Annual third-party security assessments
- [ ] **Security awareness training**: Quarterly staff training on phishing, social engineering
