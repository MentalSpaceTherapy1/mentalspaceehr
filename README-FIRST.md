## 💡 Why It Took All Night

**Issues Encountered:**
1. Local IAM user lacks deployment permissions
2. CloudFormation auto-deletes manually created resources
3. Role trust policy needed verification
4. Multiple CloudShell session issues
5. Database credential retrieval challenges

**Final Solution:**
- Deploy through CDK (infrastructure-as-code)
- Use CloudShell (has proper IAM permissions)
- Package everything into one deployment
- Auto-configuration script handles all complexity
