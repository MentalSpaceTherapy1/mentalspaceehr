### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features

#### 1. Double-Booking Prevention (60% Complete)
**What's Working:**
- Database function `check_appointment_conflict()` exists
- Checks for clinician time conflicts
- Checks for blocked time conflicts
- Validates on both INSERT and UPDATE

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Trigger not enabled (function exists but not called automatically)
- ❌ Client-side validation before drag-and-drop
- ❌ Visual indicators for conflicts in calendar
- ❌ Warning messages before creating conflicting appointments

**Required Fix:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_appointment_conflicts
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON appointments
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION check_appointment_conflict();
```

**Additional Improvements Needed:**
- Add client-side conflict check in `AppointmentDialog` before save
- Show visual warning in calendar for potential conflicts
- Add "Override conflict" permission for administrators

#### 2. Recurring Appointments (40% Complete)

- Fields: `is_recurring`, `recurrence_pattern` (JSONB), `parent_recurrence_id`
- Zod validation schema in `AppointmentDialog.tsx`
- `recurrence_pattern` structure defined:
  ```typescript
  {
    frequency: 'Daily' | 'Weekly' | 'Biweekly' | 'Monthly',
    interval: number,
    daysOfWeek?: string[],
    endDate?: date,
    numberOfOccurrences?: number
  }
  ```

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ UI components for recurring appointment creation
- ❌ Frequency selector (Daily/Weekly/Biweekly/Monthly)
- ❌ Days of week checkboxes (for weekly/biweekly)
- ❌ End condition options (end date vs number of occurrences)
- ❌ Series generation logic (create multiple appointments)
- ❌ Edit series vs single occurrence behavior
- ❌ Delete series vs single occurrence behavior
- ❌ Visual indication of recurring appointments in calendar
- ❌ "Part of series" badge or indicator

**Implementation Plan:**

2. Add checkbox "Make this a recurring appointment"
3. Show/hide recurring options based on checkbox
4. Implement series generation function in backend or frontend
5. Add "Edit Series" vs "Edit This Occurrence" dialog
6. Update calendar display to show recurring indicator
7. Implement series deletion with confirmation

#### 3. Group Session Scheduling (20% Complete)
**What's Working:**
- "Group Therapy" appointment type exists
- Basic appointment creation works

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Multi-client assignment to single appointment
- ❌ Group roster/participant list
- ❌ Maximum capacity setting
- ❌ Per-client attendance tracking
- ❌ Group-specific notes vs individual client notes
- ❌ Junction table for appointment participants

**Required Database Changes:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE appointment_participants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  appointment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES appointments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  client_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id),
  attendance_status TEXT DEFAULT 'Scheduled', -- Scheduled, Attended, Absent, Late
  check_in_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  individual_notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add to appointments table
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN max_participants INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN group_topic TEXT;
```

**UI Changes Needed:**
1. Multi-select client dropdown in `AppointmentDialog`
2. Participant list display in calendar event

    smsSentDate?: date
  }
  ```

**What Needs Implementation:**
