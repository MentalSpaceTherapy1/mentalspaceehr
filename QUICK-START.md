## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### "Error: Function already exists"
Run this first, then try again:
```bash
aws lambda delete-function --function-name MentalSpaceEhrStack-QueryDatabaseFunction --region us-east-1
aws lambda delete-function --function-name MentalSpaceEhrStack-InsertDatabaseFunction --region us-east-1
./FINAL-DEPLOY.sh
```

### "Error: Stack not found"
Your CloudFormation stack might be in a different region. Check:
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name MentalSpaceEhrStack --region us-east-1
```

### Still seeing errors after deployment
1. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Check Lambda logs:
   ```bash
   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/MentalSpaceEhrStack-QueryDatabaseFunction --follow --region us-east-1
   ```
