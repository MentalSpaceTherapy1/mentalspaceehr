# MentalSpace EHR - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Rotate Credentials (CRITICAL - Do This First!) üö®

Your Supabase credentials were in the `.env` file which was trackable in git. They must be rotated:

```bash
# Steps:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create a NEW project for production
3. Copy the new credentials
4. Update your .env file
5. NEVER use the old credentials again
```

### 2. Verify Security (5 minutes)

```bash
# Check if .env was committed to git history
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# If you see commits, credentials were exposed
# You MUST rotate them immediately
```

### 3. Test Your Setup (10 minutes)

```bash
# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Check for vulnerabilities
npm run audit:security

# Find console.log statements
npm run audit:console

# Run ALL pre-deployment checks
npm run pre-deploy
```

### 4. Test Production Build (5 minutes)

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:production

# Preview the build locally
npm run preview

# Visit http://localhost:4173
# Verify application works correctly
```

## üî• Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: TypeScript errors after enabling strict mode
**Solution:** This is expected. Fix gradually:
```bash
# See all errors
npm run type-check

# Fix file by file, starting with most critical
# You can temporarily disable strict mode if needed
```

### Issue: Console.log audit shows many issues
**Solution:** This is for tracking only, not a blocker:
```bash
# See all console.logs
npm run audit:console

# Replace gradually with logger utility
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger';
logger.info('message');  // instead of console.log
```

### Issue: npm audit shows vulnerabilities
**Solution:** Update dependencies:
```bash
npm audit fix
# Test thoroughly after updating
```

### Issue: .env file not working
**Solution:** Check the file location and format:
```bash
# .env must be in project root (mentalspaceehr/)
# Not in src/ or any subfolder
# Format: KEY=value (no spaces around =)
```
