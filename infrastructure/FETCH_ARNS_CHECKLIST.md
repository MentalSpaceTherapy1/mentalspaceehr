## üìù All Values Together

Once you have all 7 values, they should look like this:

```powershell
# Values you found:
$VPC_ID = "vpc-0abc123def456789"
$SUBNET_ID_1 = "subnet-0abc123def"
$SUBNET_ID_2 = "subnet-0ghi789jkl"
$SECURITY_GROUP_ID = "sg-0mno345pqr"
$LAMBDA_ROLE_ARN = "arn:aws:iam::706704660887:role/MentalSpaceEhrStack-LambdaExecutionRole-ABC123"
$DATABASE_LAYER_ARN = "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:706704660887:layer:MentalSpaceEhrStack-DatabaseLayer-ABC123:1"
$COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID = "us-east-1_ABC123DEF"

# Already known:
$AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
$DATABASE_SECRET_ARN = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:706704660887:secret:mentalspace-ehr-db-credentials-al4fLD"
$DATABASE_NAME = "mentalspaceehr"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Can't find VPC with "MentalSpace" name?
- Look for the default VPC or any VPC you created for this project
- Check the VPC ID in your CDK stack output or CloudFormation

### Can't find Private Subnets?
- They might be named differently (e.g., "PrivateSubnet1", "AppSubnet", etc.)
- Look for subnets that DON'T have "Public" in the name
- Check Route Table - private subnets route to NAT Gateway, not Internet Gateway

### Can't find Lambda Security Group?
- Look for any security group in your VPC
- Check CloudFormation stack outputs
- Might be named after the stack (e.g., "MentalSpaceEhrStack-LambdaSG-ABC123")

### Can't find Lambda Execution Role?
- Search for any role with "Lambda" in the name
- Check CloudFormation stack resources
- Look for role with policies: AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole

### Can't find Database Layer?
- Go to Lambda ‚Üí Layers
- If none exist, you may need to create one first (see note below)
- Layer should contain the `pg` (PostgreSQL) library

### Can't find Cognito User Pool?
- Switch to "Legacy" Cognito console if using new version
- Search for any user pool
- Check CloudFormation outputs

## üö® If Database Layer Doesn't Exist

You'll need to create it first. Quick commands:

```powershell
# Create layer directory
mkdir -p lambda-layer/nodejs
cd lambda-layer/nodejs

# Install pg library
npm init -y
npm install pg

# Go back and zip
cd ..
Compress-Archive -Path nodejs -DestinationPath database-layer.zip

# Upload to AWS
aws lambda publish-layer-version `
  --layer-name MentalSpaceEhrStack-DatabaseLayer `
  --description "PostgreSQL driver for Lambda functions" `
  --zip-file fileb://database-layer.zip `
  --compatible-runtimes nodejs20.x `
  --region us-east-1
```

This will output the Layer ARN - copy it!
