## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Actions Required BEFORE Production

### 1. Rotate Compromised Credentials üö®
**Priority: CRITICAL**

The `.env` file was in git (now fixed), so credentials are exposed:

```bash
# DO THIS IMMEDIATELY:
# 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
# 2. Create NEW project for production (don't reuse exposed one)
# 3. Update .env with new credentials
# 4. NEVER use the old credentials again
```

### 2. Verify .env is Not in Git History
**Priority: CRITICAL**

```bash
# Check if .env was ever committed:
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# If it shows commits, you MUST rotate credentials
# Consider using git-filter-repo to clean history (optional)
```

### 3. Run Dependency Updates
**Priority: HIGH**

```bash
# Update to latest security patches:
npm update

# Check for vulnerabilities:
npm audit

# Review and apply fixes (test thoroughly):
npm audit fix
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Gradual Improvements (Post-Launch)

### Code Quality (Month 1)
Priority: **Medium**

```bash
# Track progress:
npm run audit:console

# Goal: Replace 211 console.log statements with logger utility
# Strategy: Fix 10-20 per week, prioritize user-facing code
```

**Steps:**
1. Start with authentication pages (highest priority)
2. Then client management
3. Then clinical notes
4. Then admin pages
5. Then components

### TypeScript Strict Mode (Month 2)
Priority: **Medium**

Currently enabled incrementally. To fully enable:

```typescript
// tsconfig.json - change when ready
"strict": true
```

**Impact:** Will require fixing ~50-100 files
**Strategy:** Enable after console.log cleanup, fix file-by-file

### Dependency Updates (Ongoing)
Priority: **Low-Medium**

```bash
# Monthly:
npm update
npm audit fix

# Quarterly:
# Review major version updates
# Test thoroughly before applying
```
