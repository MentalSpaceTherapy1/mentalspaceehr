## 4. Known Issues & Bugs Assessment

### Critical Issues: **16 issues identified** (from COMPREHENSIVE_BUG_ASSESSMENT.md)

**Status:** All documented with fixes provided in bug assessment document.

#### High Priority Issues:
1. **Dashboard data fetching** (Today's Sessions showing 0, Pending Notes showing 0, Compliance always 100%)
2. **Schedule cancellation** (No Show option missing, cancellation email contains telehealth link)
3. **Blocked time creation errors**
4. **Time off not showing on calendar**

---

## 5. Code Quality Assessment

### ✅ **GOOD - With Minor Issues**

#### TypeScript Compilation: ✅ **PASS**
```
✓ No TypeScript errors
✓ Type checking enabled
✓ Strict checks partially enabled
```

#### ESLint Results: ⚠️ **139 warnings, 102 errors**
- **Errors:** Primarily `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` (102 instances)
- **Warnings:** React Hooks exhaustive-deps (37 instances)

**Assessment:**
- Code compiles successfully
- `any` types should be replaced with proper types for production
- Hook dependency warnings should be reviewed (may cause bugs)

⚠️ Warning: Main chunk is 3.05 MB (consider code splitting)
```

**Assessment:** Build is functional but could benefit from code splitting for performance.

#### Console Logs: ⚠️ **211 remaining**
- **Status:** Documented in CONSOLE_LOG_CLEANUP_PLAN.md
- **Progress:** 34 PHI-exposing console.logs removed (security critical)
- **Remaining:** 211 non-critical console.logs for debugging
- **Recommendation:** Replace with proper logging utility post-launch

     - User authentication and MFA
     - Client registration
     - Appointment scheduling
     - Clinical note creation and signing
     - Client portal access
     - Billing workflow

2. **Post-Launch Priority:**

- **Main chunk:** 3.05 MB (large but acceptable for complex EHR)
- **Vendor chunks:** Properly split (React, Supabase, UI libraries)

#### Database Performance:
- **Indexes:** Properly implemented on all foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- **RLS Policies:** Efficient with indexed columns
- **Query Optimization:** React Query caching implemented
- **Expected Performance:** Suitable for practices with 5-50 clinicians and 500-5000 patients

#### Scalability Considerations:
- **Current Architecture:** Suitable for small to medium practices (5-50 users)
- **Bottlenecks:** None identified at current scale
- **Supabase Limits:** Free tier supports 500 MB database, upgrade to Pro for production
- **Recommendations:**
  - Enable database connection pooling for 50+ concurrent users
  - Implement CDN for static assets (handled by deployment platform)
  - Consider code splitting for main bundle (3 MB is large)
